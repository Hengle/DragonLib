DragonLib uses code found in other public resources.
This file exists to describe and properly attribute the use of that code, and to provide licenses if required.

Eric Haines, Ken Shoemake, and Academic Press for Graphics Gems IV:
    DragonLib/Numerics/Quaternion.cs uses Eul_FromQuat + Eul_FromHMatrix

    This code repository predates the concept of Open Source, and predates most licenses along such lines. As such, the official license truly is:
    
    EULA: The Graphics Gems code is copyright-protected. In other words, you cannot claim the text of the code as your own and resell it. Using the code is permitted in any program, product, or library, non-commercial or commercial. Giving credit is not required, though is a nice gesture. The code comes as-is, and if there are any flaws or problems with any Gems code, nobody involved with Gems - authors, editors, publishers, or webmasters - are to be held responsible. Basically, don't be a jerk, and remember that anything free comes with no guarantee.
